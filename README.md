# GenLayer Weather Intelligence Library 🌦️

This library enables **GenLayer Intelligent Contracts** to interact directly with external weather APIs. By leveraging GenLayer's native web access, it eliminates the need for expensive and slow third-party oracles.

### 🧠 How it Works
This project utilizes GenLayer's **Equivalence Principle**. Since weather data is non-deterministic (it changes constantly), the library ensures that all validators reach a consensus on the temperature before it is committed to the state.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Native Web Access:** No Oracles required.
- **Real-Time Speed:** Fetches current weather data instantly.
- **Parametric Use-Cases:** Perfect for building decentralized insurance or climate-based dApps.

### 🛠️ Example Usage
Simply import the `WeatherOracle` class into your GenLayer Studio project to begin fetching real-world environmental data
